### Using National Cloud
This integration allows the user to select the national cloud that should be used for the integration. Please refer to the [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments) for more information about national clouds.
By default, the integration uses the worldwide endpoint. In order to use a different endpoint, select from the `National Cloud` dropdown the required endpoint.
